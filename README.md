The official implementation of ReaSon


## 📢 News

- **[2025.11.8]** 🎉🎉 Our paper **"ReaSon: Reinforced Causal Search with Information Bottleneck for Video Understanding"** has been **accepted to AAAI 2026**!

## 🧩 To-Do List

- [ ] 📄 Release the paper (arXiv preprint & project page)  
- [ ] 💻 Release the official code and training pipeline

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

Our implementation builds upon and is inspired by the following excellent open-source projects:

- [**TStar**](https://github.com/mll-lab-nu/TStar): for the heuristic frame selection strategy that inspired the initial stage of our reinforced search pipeline.  
- [**LLaVA-NeXT**](https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-NeXT): for providing a strong vision-language backbone and training framework that facilitated our visual-language modeling.
